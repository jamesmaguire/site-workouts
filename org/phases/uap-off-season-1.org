* Schedule & Workout Logs
   [[file:uap-pdfs/offseason1.pdf][Workout log (pdf)]]

   The main goal of this phase is to focus on building strength in the weight room. The lifting sessions are your priority this phase. We are going to load more weight on movements similar to what you practiced in the prep phase. If you need to leave something out this phase, skip the conditioning.

   We are assuming each lifting session is about one hour, core circuits are about 10-15 minutes, each conditioning session is about 30 minutes (including warmup), and each SAQ session is about 20 minutes (including warmup).

   - Conditioning workouts can always be done after the leg strength training day because it does not matter that your legs are already tired.
   - SAQ workouts are NOT conditioning. Do NOT do more than what is listed. You should feel fully recovered between reps and sets. If not, add more rest. No big deal.
   - If doing two types of sessions on the same day, SAQ should be done before lifting or conditioning. Lifting should be done before conditioning.
   - Learn to pay attention to how your body is feeling each day. If you start feeling run down by the end of each week, you may not be getting enough recovery. It is okay NOT to do all of the workouts provided. Sometimes less is more.

   [[https://s3.amazonaws.com/ultimate-athlete-project/Schedule+Screenshots/Off-Season_1.png]]

   Building strength is the main focus of this phase. Too much conditioning can be counterproductive to this goal, so keep your volume of conditioning low.

   If you want to do extra work, invest more time in your core. Core circuits can be done 3-6 days per week. Don't start off right away with 6 days/week-work up to it. Alternate between circuit 1 and circuit 2.

   Conditioning *can* be done 6 days per week *but only if* you keep the volume low enough to recover between sessions. Do not let your conditioning interfere with your lifting work this phase.

   You can also spend more time doing more tissue quality work this phase. Get yourself on a foam rolling routine now. It's best to have a routine for self-maintenance in place before you need it!

   For the 4days/week cycle, if you can fit in 10 min of conditioning 1-2X/week that would also be good.

   As always, the 2days/week cycle is not going to get you far and is more like an in-emergency plan.

* Conditioning 1 & 2
   Conditioning 1 should be preceded by the [[https://www.ultyresults.com/products/ultimate-athlete-project/categories/89306/posts/231475][Linear Warmup]].

   Conditioning 2 should be preceded by the [[https://www.ultyresults.com/products/ultimate-athlete-project/categories/89306/posts/231481][Nonlinear Warmup]].

** Conditioning 1: Linear

   This is a continuation of the preparation phase with a few shuttle runs thrown in the mix. This workout can be done on an ultimate field doing your 80% sprints the full length of the field plus endzones.

   The shuttle runs can be done across the field; twice across-and-back counts as one shuttle run. The shuttle runs should be done at top speed. This is why the recovery between shuttle runs is longer.

** Conditioning 2: Non-linear

   These exercises should be done as a circuit. All exercises are done for 30 seconds with 90 seconds rest. First to skater hops, rest 90 seconds, shuffle, rest 90 seconds, short shuttle, etc. until the prescribed reps of each exercise are done.

     - about 10 yards

** A3. Short Shuttle
     - This can vary, but I do 5 yards, 10 yards
* Indoor Conditioning 1 & 2
** How to complete these circuits
    - Alternate between jumps and bodyweight exercises
    - Perform 20 seconds of the Jump/Plyo then move onto the bodyweight exercise
    - Complete the circuit straight through
    - Rest 1 min between circuits
    - Do this number of circuits:

      For Workout 1, do the same number of circuits as the week nos, e.g. week 3 = 3 times through. For Workout 2, do 2 circuits in the first week, 3 circuits in all other weeks.
