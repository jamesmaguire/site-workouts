    -   Feel a slight stretch in the abs at the initiation of the movement
    -   Contract the abs until the back is flat
    -   Hold the weight directly above your eyes and aim up for the sky as
      you contract

    -   Keep hips level.
    -   Resist rotation of the torso and hips as you pull.
    -   This exercise may not feel difficult. You won't "feel the burn."
      That's ok. It's a total core exercise working on balance and core
      coordination.
