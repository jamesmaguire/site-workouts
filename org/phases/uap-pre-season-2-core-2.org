* A1. Pre-stretch Crunches with DB

    {{{youtube(E3tF_mL21wY)}}}


    -   Feel a slight stretch in the abs at the initiation of the movement
    -   Contract the abs until the back is flat
    -   Hold the weight directly above your eyes and aim up for the sky as
      you contract

* A2. 1-arm 1-leg cable row

    {{{youtube(hJRCQh02QHI)}}}


    -   Keep hips level.
    -   Resist rotation of the torso and hips as you pull.
    -   This exercise may not feel difficult. You won't "feel the burn."
      That's ok. It's a total core exercise working on balance and core
      coordination.

* A3. Kneeling Half-chop

    {{{youtube(X6GjkIVLE9Q)}}}


    -   Knee closest to the cable column is bent
    -   Look at the weight as you pull it across your body
