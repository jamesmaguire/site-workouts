* A note on scheduling your core sessions
    The core workout of this phase also includes some power exercises. For this reason, keep two days in between your leg and core workouts. (You always want to do this anyway, because our core programs include the hips)

    - Hold the weight directly above your eyes and aim up for the sky as you contract
