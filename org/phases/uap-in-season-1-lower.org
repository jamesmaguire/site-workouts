    -   The bar is resting on your clavicles (collarbone) and held there
      with your hands in an open grip (fingers not wrapped around the
      bar).
    -   As in all squatting, maintain a neutral spine, get your butt back,
      weight shifted toward the heels, and chest tall.

*  A2. Tuck Jumps

    -   Minimize ground contact time.
    -   Land quietly on the mid-forefoot and explode up again as quickly as
      possible.
    -   Pull your knees up as high as possible.
    -   Keep the spine neutral and chest tall! Knees come up to meet the
      chest, not the other way around.

*  B1. Barbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)

    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/XxM-QNjznF0/hqdefault.jpg]]

    -   Get your hips back. Knees bent at about 10-15 degrees.
    -   Maintain a neutral spine!
    -   Keep the weight close to your legs (not doing so will cause you to
      use your back)
    -   Lower the weight until you feel the slight stretch in the back of
      your hamstrings.
    -   Use your glutes and hamstrings to push your hips forward and cause
      you to stand up.

*  B2. Walking Lunges

    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/NTiYltLIVB0]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/NTiYltLIVB0/hqdefault.jpg]]

    -   Aim for 90 degree angle of the lunging knee but do not let your back
      knee touch the ground.
    -   Step directly into the next lunge without pausing at the top of the
      movement.
    -   Keep your shoulders locked back and chest up.
    -   (Reps are per leg, not total)

*  C1. Stability Ball Hip Extension / Lying Curl

    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/h1Us6x0fuPI]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/h1Us6x0fuPI/hqdefault.jpg]]

    -   First raise your hips to parallel by squeezing your glutes.
    -   Maintain the tension in your glutes to keep your hip us as you bring
      the ball toward you
    -   Knees, hips, and shoulders should all be in a line at the top of the
      movement.
    -   Allow the ball to move away from you in a controlled fashion.
    -   Lower your hips again to complete the movement.

*  Alternate two legged version

    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/MEqwmz-nfVo]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/MEqwmz-nfVo/hqdefault.jpg]]

    -   If single leg is too difficult (it's definitely not easy!) it's
      better to have good form on the two legged version.

*  C2. Romanian Rhythm Squats

    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmWbus0fmdo]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/MmWbus0fmdo/hqdefault.jpg]]

    -   Fast quarter squats. Alternate 10 reps with the whole foot on the
      ground with ten reps going up on your toes until you get to 50 reps.
    -   Concentrate on using your hips. Maintain good posture as usual.
