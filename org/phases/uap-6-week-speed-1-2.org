* Fast feet

  - center of mass should be between your feet
  - you can use a cone or line to provide some visual feedback about your ability to stay in the same location but try to avoid looking too much at your feet

* Lateral fast feet

  - center of mass stays approximately over the cone
  - inside foot touches the ground very lightly, mostly for balance
  - aim for speed, rhythm, and control
