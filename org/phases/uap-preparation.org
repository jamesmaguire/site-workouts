* Schedule & Workout Logs
   [[file:uap-pdfs/preparation0.pdf][Workout log (pdf)]]
** General Principles
     We are assuming each lifting session is about one hour, core circuits are about 10-15 minutes, each conditioning session is about 30-45 minutes (including warmup), and each SAQ session is about 20 minutes (including warmup).

** Your Schedule
     [[https://s3.amazonaws.com/ultimate-athlete-project/Schedule+Screenshots/Preparation.png]]

     - Keep 2 days between the Lifting ("Strength") and the SAQ workouts.
     - SAQ workouts are NOT conditioning. Do NOT do more than what is listed. You should feel fully recovered between reps and sets. If not, add more rest. No big deal.
     - If doing more than one type of sessions on the same day...
       - SAQ should be done first, before Lifting or Conditioning
       - Lifting should be done before Conditioning
       - Conditioning always comes last!
       - Core can be done whenever
     - Learn to pay attention to how your body is feeling each day. If you start feeling run down by the end of each week, you may not be getting enough recovery. It is okay NOT to do all of the workouts provided. Sometimes less is more.

* Strength 1
** A1. DB Split Squat
     - keep your chest tall and shoulders back
     - as you descend, shoulders and hips should stay in in a line (don't lean forward)

     - reach back between your legs with the rope attachement.
     - use your glutes to push your hips forward and stand up.

** B1. Semi supinated Chin Up

     - keep your chest up. queeze shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.
     - If you do not have an assisted chinup machine, you can use a lat pulldown instead.

     - Hold a dumbbell only in one hand while performing this exercise.
     - Engage the core to resist rotation.

** C1. Stability Ball Hip Raise to Bridge

     - if you imagine an archer, you will naturally do this exercise correctly

* Strength 2

* Core 1
   A core circuit will take 10-12 minutes. The core circuits can be done 2-3 times a week alternating between the two circuits (Core 1 & [[https://www.ultyresults.com/products/uap/categories/69150/posts/324352][Core 2]]). Alternatively, they can be done before or after playing or conditioning of after an SAQ session.

   Perform the circuit 3 times through with norest or minimal rest between exercises and sets.

    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqOPjpN-1go]]

* SAQ 1 & 2
   These SAQ (Speed, Agility, Quickness) modules can be done before the conditioning sessions or lifting sessions. They should be done *after* a dynamic warmup to reap the greatest benefit. One module has a linear emphasis, the other has a lateral emphasis. Do the linear warmup before the linear SAQ and the lateral warmup before the lateral SAQ. It will make most sense to do the linear SAQ before the linear conditioning and the lateral SAQ before the lateral conditioning.

   SAQ modules can be done 2-4 times per week alternating between the linear and lateral option.

   SAQ 1: Linear SAQ

** Box Jumps
    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/tVnU1kwoIMM]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/tVnU1kwoIMM/hqdefault.jpg]]

    - knee angle at takeoff should be approximately the same as knee angle upon landing. If knee angle is less than 90 degrees, your box is definitely too high.
    - practice landing quietly

** Forward Frog Jumps
    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/09KPdgduavA]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/09KPdgduavA/hqdefault.jpg]]

    - the purpose of this drill is to get full extension of ankels, knees, and hips
    - propel yourself explosively upward and a little bit forward

    SAQ 2: Lateral SAQ

** Lateral Bound and Stick
    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/jnGMnjRXNAI]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/jnGMnjRXNAI/hqdefault.jpg]]

    - bound sideways as far as you can while still being able to stick the landing
    - bend your knees to absorb the landing and land quietly

** Single Leg Box Jumps - Medial
    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/iYteMFa1GlQ]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/iYteMFa1GlQ/hqdefault.jpg]]

    -

** Single Leg Box Jumps - Lateral
    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/waVdgd9JPVw]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/waVdgd9JPVw/hqdefault.jpg]]

    - choose a 4-8 inch box or step
    - jump laterally and land as quietly as possible
    - stick the landing with no additional hopping
* Conditioning 1 & 2
   In our preparatory conditioning we're going to start at the very beginning and build gradually. The main focus in the next month will be building strength but we want to also build up some work capacity to be better able to recover from our workouts.

   Like the SAQ modules, there is a linear day and a lateral day. The linear or lateral warmup should precede these workouts. You should do conditioning at least 3 times per week (up to five times per week if you want) alternating linear and lateral days.

   These workouts are short enough to do after a lifting session if necessary.

** Conditioning 1: 80/20 Workout
    This session will work on your Linear conditioning.

    - Run at about 75-80% of your full sprint speed for 20 seconds. Walk or rest for 40 seconds. This is one rep.
    - Choose 8-10 reps as your starting point. It should be easy.
    - The pace your running should naturally have you landing on your forefoot.
    - Add 1-2 reps each week.
    - you should not be sore the next day.

** Conditioning 2: Skater Hops with Cone Touch
    This session will work on your Lateral conditioning.

    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/OTUNlc93jac]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/OTUNlc93jac/hqdefault.jpg]]

    - Full intensity for 30 seconds. rest 90 seconds. Repeat 3 times
    - Add one repetition each week.
