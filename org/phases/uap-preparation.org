* Schedule & Workout Logs
   [[file:../../docs/uap-pdfs/preparation0.pdf][Workout log (pdf)]]
** General Principles
     We are assuming each lifting session is about one hour, core circuits are about 10-15 minutes, each conditioning session is about 30-45 minutes (including warmup), and each SAQ session is about 20 minutes (including warmup).

** Your Schedule
     [[https://s3.amazonaws.com/ultimate-athlete-project/Schedule+Screenshots/Preparation.png]]

     - Keep 2 days between the Lifting ("Strength") and the SAQ workouts.
     - SAQ workouts are NOT conditioning. Do NOT do more than what is listed. You should feel fully recovered between reps and sets. If not, add more rest. No big deal.
     - If doing more than one type of sessions on the same day...
       - SAQ should be done first, before Lifting or Conditioning
       - Lifting should be done before Conditioning
       - Conditioning always comes last!
       - Core can be done whenever
     - Learn to pay attention to how your body is feeling each day. If you start feeling run down by the end of each week, you may not be getting enough recovery. It is okay NOT to do all of the workouts provided. Sometimes less is more.
