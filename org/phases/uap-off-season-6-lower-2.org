    -   Bring the ball down between your legs
    -   Think about pushing your hips back as if in a deadlift
    -   Use your whole body (pop those hips forward!) to propel the ball us
      and back over your head
    -   Ignore the sprinting in the video!

    -   Stand on one leg holding the medicine ball in both hands.
    -   The throw should feel like a single leg countermovement jump except
      that the ball is propelled straight up and you stay mostly on the
      ground.
    -   The medicine ball should be light (approx. 4-8 pounds).
    -   If you do not have a medicine ball, leap off of one leg and land on
      both feet.

*  B1. Deadlift

    -   Shoulders retracted.
    -   Spine neutral. Look at a spot on the floor about 5 feet in front of
      you.
    -   Get your hips back and chest over the bar
    -   Arms should be straight at the start of the lift
    -   Back remains flat as hips come forward and weight lifts up.

*  B2. Box Jumps

    -   Find a bench, box, or other object that allows you to land on it
      with a knee angle of greater than 90 degrees. Otherwise, the surface
      is definitely too high.
    -   Land softly with the entire foot on the surface.

*  C1. Paused Heel-Elevated Hip Lift

    -   Elevate the foot of the working leg on a step
    -   Can be elevated on a Bosu ball for added difficulty.
    -   Nonworking leg remains straight
    -   Pause at the top of the movement

*  C2. Speed Calf Raises

    -   Place your midfoot on a step or box. Hold onto something to help
      your balance.
    -   Get full range of motion on these and really squeeze your calves at
      the top for a full contraction
    -   Do these as quickly and explosively as possible without jumping.
