  -   Find a rhythm and move quickly
  -   Aim for parallel in the squats
  -   The press should move continuously with momentum coming from the
    squat

* Alternate between following this circuit up with either:

  -   Explosively step forward again using primarily the front leg
  -   Keep the back foot off the ground when you stand up again if
    possible
  -   Do all reps on one leg first and then the other

*  Day 2. Russian Step Ups

  -   find a rhythm, be explosive, drive the knee up!
  -   Use the foot on the bench to initiate and drive the movement. Don't
    "bounce" off the foot landing on the ground.
