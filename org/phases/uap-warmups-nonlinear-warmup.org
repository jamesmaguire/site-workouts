   This is a complete nonlinear warmup. This is the warmup you should do before nonlinear conditioning, SAQ modules, and before playing.

   All exercises are performed for about 20 yards (except the ones that are stationary)

* Part 1: Physical Warm Up
    Each for 35m/40yards...

    1.  Run at 60% speed
    2.  Backwards run with large steps
    3.  Run at 60% speed
    4.  Backward skip/shuffle
    5.  Casual (low intensity) skip
    6.  Low intensity shuffle. Change direction you're facing every four steps

* Part 3: Nervous System
    All exercises should be done for about 15 yards unless otherwise noted. *Allow some rest between exercises* so that you can move at high intensity with quick, light feet. The purpose here is NOT to elevate your heart rate, but to prepare your nervous system to recuit the maximum number of fast twitch muscle fibers as quickly as possible.

*
* 1. Cycle kicks
* 2. Lateral high knee skip
* 3. Backwards run
* 4. Lateral skips
