    -   Engage the lower core to keep hips stable.
    -   Check for hip motion in the lowering leg by placing your hand above
      the hip bone.
    -   Lower only as far as there is no movement of the hip.
    -   If you cannot do this exercise as shown, start with the non working
      leg propped against something (a doorframe works well) to keep it
      upright.
