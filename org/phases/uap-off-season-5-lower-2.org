    -   find a rhythm, be explosive, drive the knee up!
    -   Use the foot on the bench to initiate and drive the movement. Don't
      "bounce" off the foot landing on the ground.

    -   Find a rhythm and move quickly
    -   Aim for parallel in the squats
    -   The press should move continuously with momentum coming from the
      squat

*  B1. DB King Squat

    -   First part of the exercise is a pendulum RDL. Keep knee at about 10
      degree bend. Get the back leg's thigh close to parallel.
    -   On one leg squat down getting the weight close to (but not touching)
      the ground. Attempt to keep the rest of the body frozen in the RDL
      position
    -   Keep your back flat and shoulders retracted through the whole
      exercises.
    -   (Note that some of my demo reps are better than others. :-)
      Hopefully you get the idea. This one's new for me too. Good luck!)

*  B2. Diagonal Walking DB Lunge

    -   Keep toes and hips forward. Lunge diagonal to the forward direction.
    -   It may become difficult to hold the dumbells. You can either think
      of this as grip strength training or use straps. Pretty sure you can
      get straps for less than $15 at most sporting goods stores.
