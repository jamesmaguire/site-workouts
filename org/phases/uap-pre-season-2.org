* Schedule & Workout Logs
   [[file:uap-pdfs/preseason2.pdf][Workout log (pdf)]]

   This is the second phase of preseason work. The main goals are strength
   and power endurance. We are going to accomplish these goals primarily
   using circuit training. You'll do a power circuit twice per week and a
   strength circuit once per week. Workouts will be very short but very
   intense.

   The SAQ work will be done before the conditioning workouts this week.
   This is mostly for maintenance and don't expect to see big gains in
   speed this phase.

** General Principles

    -   Learn to pay attention to how your body is feeling each day. If you
      start feeling run down by the end of each week, you may not be
      getting enough recovery. It is okay NOT to do all of the workouts
      provided. Sometimes less is more.
    -   If you feel nauseated or dizzy, increase the rest periods. Making
      yourself vomit will not help the speed of your adaptation.

    For this phase we have a split in training, depending on what surface
    your season is focussed on...

    -   If GRASS --> use the standard Conditioning & SAQs
    -   If BEACH --> use the Beach Conditioning & SAQs

    [[https://s3.amazonaws.com/ultimate-athlete-project/Schedule+Screenshots/Pre-Season_2.png]]

    Core circuits can be done 3-6 days per week. Alternate between circuit 1
    and circuit 2.

    Conditioning *can* be done 6 days per week *but only if* you keep the
    volume low enough to recover between sessions. *If you want to do
    conditioning on the same day as the circuit training, separate the
    workouts by a few hours*. This will allow you to do more work and still
    recover.
* Strength

**  A1. Semi-supinated grip Pull-ups

    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/R-j7IvquHwE]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/R-j7IvquHwE/hqdefault.jpg]]

    -   "semi-supinated" means that your palms are facing one another. If
      you do not have a bar that allows for this, use a supinated grip
      (palms toward you)
    -   keep your chest up. Squeeze shoulder blades together at the top of
      the movement.
    -   If you do not have an assisted chinup machine, you can use a lat
      pulldown instead.

**  A2. Bodyweight (BW) Squats

    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/IpkzKC2mt7c]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/IpkzKC2mt7c/hqdefault.jpg]]

    -   Get below parallel on each rep
    -   Arms are extended to help maintain balance and keep weight on heels

** B1. Bench Dips

       movement
     -   Keep elbows parallel, not caving in or flaring out

**  B2. 45 Degree Lunges (BW)

    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/o9MgO2kMiAM]]

    -   With minimal ground contact time, jump up again into the next
      scissor.

   For the power circuit, exercises should be done as quickly as possible
   while maintaining good form. Keep your mental focus during this workout
   and get at it!

**  A1. Single Arm DB High Pull

    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/qagm6U0CDLA]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/qagm6U0CDLA/hqdefault.jpg]]

     -   Set up 2 rows of cones about 5-7 yards apart. In each row, three
       cones are placed about 8 yards apart. The two rows are off set by 4
       yards to create a zig-zag pattern.

     [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/zwHfN0hlEVc]]
     [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/zwHfN0hlEVc/hqdefault.jpg]]

     -   Attempt to cut on the inside foot rather than the outside foot (like
       in the jab step).
     -   To use the inside foot, you'll likely slow down a bit before the
       cone and "switch your hips"

**  Conditioning 2: Linear and Disc

** A. Shuttle with Throwing

     Backhand

     [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/vLcyN6ZUlns]]

    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/dmF-RPmsN6g/hqdefault.jpg]]

    -   This position is most easily obtained with a partner sitting on your
      feet. I have also done it hooking my lower foot under a 60 pound
      dumbbell on the bench.
    -   Maintain constant tension in the obliques as you lower yourself
      toward the floor. Bring yourself up to parallel or above parallel as
      you are able.

    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/hJRCQh02QHI/hqdefault.jpg]]

    -   Keep hips level.
    -   Resist rotation of the torso and hips as you pull.
    -   This exercise may not feel difficult. You won't "feel the burn."
      That's ok. It's a total core exercise working on balance and core
      coordination.

** A3. Kneeling Half-chop

    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/X6GjkIVLE9Q]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/X6GjkIVLE9Q/hqdefault.jpg]]

**  Conditioning 2

** 150 Shuttle (6x 25m)

     [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/cpAnh4vAmrA]]
     [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/cpAnh4vAmrA/hqdefault.jpg]]

     -   Setup 2 cones 25m apart
     -   One rep is 6 sprints of 25m length, no rest between sprints
     -   You will always do 8 reps total across the two sets, for a total of
       1200m of running.
     -   Sets change each week, but will typically look like "5,3", ie 5
       reps in set 1, 3 reps in set 2.  So in set 1 you would do 5 reps = 5
       x ( 6x25m, followed by 60sec rest)
