    - Engage the lower core to keep hips stable.
    - Check for hip motion in the lowering leg by placing your hand above the hip bone.
    - Lower only as far as there is no movement of the hip.
    - If you cannot do this exercise as shown, start with the non working leg propped against something (a doorframe works well) to keep it upright.
