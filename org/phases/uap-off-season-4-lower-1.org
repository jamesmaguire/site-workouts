* A. Rotational Scoop Toss
  {{{youtube(yqM86sNdRzU)}}}

  - Start with hips perpendicular to the wall.
  - Throw the ball as hard as you can at the wall. Try to break the wall.
  - After follow through, hips should be about square to the wall.

* B1. Snatch Progression
  {{{youtube(Zo2K2l9rMp0)}}}

  - All about the hips. Get hips back.
  - "Jump" the weight up.
  - Keep the weight close to your body. Should come straight up, not out away from your body.
  - Lock out elbows in the catch.
  - If you do not have the shoulder mobility required for this exercise or it is otherwise uncomfortable, try dumb bell snatches instead. Do 6 reps - three in each hand.
  - Here's an (Alternate) DB Snatch Progression: {{{youtubelink(lDQscKAcVcM)}}}

* B2. Box Jumps
  {{{youtube(tVnU1kwoIMM)}}}

  - Find a bench, box, or other object that allows you to land on it with a knee angle of greater than 90 degrees. Otherwise, the surface is definitely too high.
  - Land softly with the entire foot on the surface.

* C1. Backward Lunges
  {{{youtube(BYbEvMbOfMI)}}}

  - Step back with one leg. Do not let your knee touch the ground
  - Explosively step forward again using primarily the front leg
  - Keep the back foot off the ground when you stand up again if possible
  - Do all reps on one leg first and then the other

* C2.Barbell RDL
  {{{youtube(XxM-QNjznF0)}}}

  - Keep back flat
  - Knees at about 10 degree angle throughout the movement
  - Lock out hips at the top. (knees may now be more straight but not locked)
