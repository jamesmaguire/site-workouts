    - Start with hips perpendicular to the wall.
    - Throw the ball as hard as you can at the wall. Try to break the wall.

    - All about the hips. Get hips back.
    - "Jump" the weight up.
    - Keep the weight close to your body. Should come straight up, not out away from your body.
    - Lock out elbows in the catch.
    - If you do not have the shoulder mobility required for this exercise or it is otherwise uncomfortable, try dumb bell snatches instead. Do 6 reps - three in each hand.

    - Find a bench, box, or other object that allows you to land on it with a knee angle of greater than 90 degrees. Otherwise, the surface is definitely too high.
    - Land softly with the entire foot on the surface.

    - Keep back flat
    - Knees at about 10 degree angle throughout the movement
    - Lock out hips at the top. (knees may now be more straight but not locked)
