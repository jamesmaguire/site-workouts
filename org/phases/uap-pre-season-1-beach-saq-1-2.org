*  SAQ 1

* A. Zigzag Sprints

  {{{youtube(YdgYleKenGM)}}}

  -   Set up 2 rows of cones about 5-7 yards apart. In each row, three
    cones are placed about 8 yards apart. The two rows are off set by 4
    yards to create a zig-zag pattern.

* B. Figure Eight Sprints

  -   Attempt to cut on the inside foot rather than the outside foot (like
    in the jab step).
  -   To use the inside foot, you'll likely slow down a bit before the
    cone and "switch your hips"

*  SAQ 2

* Three Point Start to 45m Sprint

  {{{youtube(j76bJSWSKzg)}}}

  -   Hips up. Feet should be closer to hands than you might think.
  -   Lean over the hand on the ground. You should feel that you are close
    to falling over.
  -   You should feel some tension in the hamstrings like you are a spring
    ready to bounce.
  -   Accelerate as explosively as possible out of the starting position.
