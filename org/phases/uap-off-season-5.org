* Schedule & Workout Logs
   [[file:uap-pdfs/offseason5.pdf][Workout log (pdf)]]

   This is the last phase in which we focus on Strength, and we'll add a
   bit of an emphasis on strength endurance. Because of this, you won't
   get as much benefit from SAQ work and so we have cut that back to once
   per week for this phase.

** General principles

    -   Conditioning workouts can always be done after the leg strength
      training day because it does not matter that your legs are already
      tired.
    -   SAQ workouts are NOT conditioning. Do NOT do more than what is
      listed. You should feel fully recovered between reps and sets. If
      not, add more rest. No big deal.
    -   If doing two types of sessions on the same day, SAQ should be done
      before lifting or conditioning. Lifting should be done before
      conditioning.
    -   Learn to pay attention to how your body is feeling each day. If you
      start feeling run down by the end of each week, you may not be
      getting enough recovery. It is okay NOT to do all of the workouts
      provided. Sometimes less is more.

    [[https://s3.amazonaws.com/ultimate-athlete-project/Schedule+Screenshots/Off-Season_5.png]]

    Lifting is scheduled four times per week this phase.

    If you want to do more work, invest more time in tissue quality work
    (foam rolling and stretching), mobility drills, and the warm up drills.

    Conditioning *can* be done multiple days per week *but only if* you keep
    the volume low enough to recover between sessions. SAQ can be done twice
    per week but your legs may not be fully recovered enough to get the
    maximum benefits from SAQ work.

**  A1. Barbell paused Rear Foot Elevated Split Squat

    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/QK3J4Xwv3Ww]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/QK3J4Xwv3Ww/hqdefault.jpg]]

    -   Back foot can be dorsiflexed or flat. whatever position is
      comfortable and stable is fine
    -   Pause at the bottom of the movement
    -   Keep shoulders retracted, chest up, and a neutral spine
    -   Knee should track in line with the toes

**  A2. Split squat jump for height

    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bo_Rg5fhZMQ]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/Bo_Rg5fhZMQ/hqdefault.jpg]]

    -   Get low but do not let the back knee smash into the ground
    -   Jump as high as possible and switch which leg is forward mid-flight
    -   Arms can do whatever but using them as you would if running will
      likely feel most natural

**  B1. Single Leg Barbell RDL

    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/d567Ek9MNK8]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/d567Ek9MNK8/hqdefault.jpg]]

    -   Maintain a neutral spine. This is more important than how low you
      go!
    -   Start with the knee of the foot on the ground slightly bent and keep
      the same angle throughtout the movement.
    -   Lower the weight until you feel tension in the hamstring
    -   Hips should move back as you lower the weight.
    -   Contract the glute/hamstring to push your hip forward as you stand
      up.
    -   Do not touch the other leg to the ground at any time if you can help
      it
    -   Do all reps on one leg, then switch to the other leg

    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/rs65GbhEBQA]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/rs65GbhEBQA/hqdefault.jpg]]

    -   Use your glutes/hamstrings and keep the spine neutral (don't arch
      your back to get the hips up)
    -   Keep your hips up and envision a straight line between knees and
      shoulders
    -   The exercise can be done with one leg at a time if two legs is not
      challenging

**  C2. Romanian Rhythm Squat

    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmWbus0fmdo]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/MmWbus0fmdo/hqdefault.jpg]]

    -   Neutral spine, knees in line with toes
    -   Alternate ten reps of quarter squats with ten reps of quarter squats
      to up on your toes
    -   This means you will do 30 regular quarter squats and 20 quarter
      squats to up on toes total
    -   Choose a weight that would be approximately what you could use for
      regular back squats for 10-12 reps (This is an estimate to help you
      know where to start. Your final weight choice may vary)
    -   You will not go to failure on this exercise. Stay fast.

      degree bend. Get the back leg's thigh close to parallel.
    -   On one leg squat down getting the weight close to (but not touching)
      the ground. Attempt to keep the rest of the body frozen in the RDL
      position
    -   Keep your back flat and shoulders retracted through the whole
      exercises.

    -   Keep toes and hips forward. Lunge diagonal to the forward direction.
    -   It may become difficult to hold the dumbells. You can either think
      of this as grip strength training or use straps. Pretty sure you can
      get straps for less than $15 at most sporting goods stores.
