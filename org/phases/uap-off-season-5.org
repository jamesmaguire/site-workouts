* Schedule & Workout Logs
   [[file:../uap-pdfs/offseason5.pdf][Workout log (pdf)]]

   This is the last phase in which we focus on Strength, and we'll add a
   bit of an emphasis on strength endurance. Because of this, you won't
   get as much benefit from SAQ work and so we have cut that back to once
   per week for this phase.

** General principles

    -   Conditioning workouts can always be done after the leg strength
      training day because it does not matter that your legs are already
      tired.
    -   SAQ workouts are NOT conditioning. Do NOT do more than what is
      listed. You should feel fully recovered between reps and sets. If
      not, add more rest. No big deal.
    -   If doing two types of sessions on the same day, SAQ should be done
      before lifting or conditioning. Lifting should be done before
      conditioning.
    -   Learn to pay attention to how your body is feeling each day. If you
      start feeling run down by the end of each week, you may not be
      getting enough recovery. It is okay NOT to do all of the workouts
      provided. Sometimes less is more.

    Lifting is scheduled four times per week this phase.

    If you want to do more work, invest more time in tissue quality work
    (foam rolling and stretching), mobility drills, and the warm up drills.

    Conditioning *can* be done multiple days per week *but only if* you keep
    the volume low enough to recover between sessions. SAQ can be done twice
    per week but your legs may not be fully recovered enough to get the
    maximum benefits from SAQ work.
