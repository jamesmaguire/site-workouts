     -   Hips up. Feet should be closer to hands than you might think.
     -   Lean over the hand on the ground. You should feel that you are close
       to falling over.
     -   You should feel some tension in the hamstrings like you are a spring
       ready to bounce.
     -   Accelerate as explosively as possible out of the starting position.
