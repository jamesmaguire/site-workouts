* Schedule & Workout Logs
   [[file:uap-pdfs/offseason6.pdf][Workout log (pdf)]]

   - Keep 2 days between the legs and SAQ Day 1 workouts.
   - Conditioning workouts can always be done after the leg strength
   training day because it does not matter that your legs are already
   tired.
   - SAQ workouts are NOT conditioning. Do NOT do more than what is
   listed. You should feel fully recovered between reps and sets. If
   not, add more rest. No big deal.
   - If doing two types of sessions on the same day, SAQ should be done
   before lifting or conditioning. Lifting should be done before
   conditioning.
   - Learn to pay attention to how your body is feeling each day. If you
   start feeling run down by the end of each week, you may not be
   getting enough recovery. It is okay NOT to do all of the workouts
   provided. Sometimes less is more.

   Conditioning *can* be done 6 days per week *but only if* you keep the
   volume low enough to recover between sessions. *Do not let your
   conditioning interfere with your lifting and SAQ work this phase.* If
   you want to build up your conditioning, do easy (low volume)
   conditioning workouts. Even if the warmup and workout only takes 20
   minutes, it will have a very positive cumulative effect.

   If you want to do more work, you can also invest more time in your core.
   Core circuits can be done 3-6 days per week. Alternate between circuit 1
   and circuit 2.

      not do this exercise. You can try single arm dumbell snatches as an

      bent!
