   On this page you'll find everything you need for the conditioning workouts. Remember all of these workouts should be preceded by a proper dynamic warmup. See the [[https://ultyresults.mykajabi.com/products/uap/categories/89306/posts/231475][Linear]] and [[https://ultyresults.mykajabi.com/products/uap/categories/89306/posts/231481][Multidirectional Warmup]] pages for details.

   In this phase you have three types of conditioning workouts. Conditioning is the focus of this phase, so you should try to do conditioning 4-6 times per week. The Tabata conditioning should be done no more than twice. The Linear Conditioning and Recovery workout should be done at least once.
* Conditioning 1: Tabata
    The Tabata conditioning should be done no more than twice in a week. Your reps are simple: sprint for 20 seconds, rest for 10.
* Conditioning 2: With Disc
* A1. Kill Drill

* Conditioning 3: Linear & Recovery
    This should be an easy day. You'll run at about 70% of sprint speed (the pace of a fast mile) for 30seconds, then rest for seconds. That's one rep. Do however many reps feel comfortable.
