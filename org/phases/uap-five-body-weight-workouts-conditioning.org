This session involves lots of jumping! So get your sneakers on and just follow along with these guys.

This workout is one of our indoor conditioning sessions in the UAP. Brought to you by former Pitt captain, Jonah Wisch!

You'll need 10mins for the workout, and all the instructions are written on screen so you can listen to any tunes you like!

Go through this circuit 2x this week and up to 3x as you build up endurance. Rest 1-2 minutes between circuits. This workout can be done 1-2 times/week.
