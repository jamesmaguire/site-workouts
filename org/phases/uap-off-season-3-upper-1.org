    - "semi supinated" means that your palms are facing one another. If you do not have a bar that allows for this, use a supinated grip (palms toward you)
    - keep your chest up. Squeeze shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.
    - If you do not have an assisted chinup machine, you can use a lat pulldown instead.
