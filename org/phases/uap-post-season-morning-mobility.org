   You may be relaxing your workout and warm up regimen in the post season, and that's fine. We want this month to be a time of regeneration. An important part of regeneration is getting blood and nutrients to the joints and muscle tissues of the body.

   Doing some mobility work every day is a great way to keep the joints healthy and mobile so they're ready to get back in action when you're ready to start your training again.

   This is a morning mobility routine that I use to loosen up my spine, shoulders, and hips on mornings when I'm feeling not so great. When I do this routine regularly, I'm more relaxed throughout the day.

   The beauty of this routine is that it takes less than ten minutes once you learn all of the moves. Make this part of your morning routine just like brushing your teeth. You can also sprinkle these movements throughout the day. Eagle shoulders are my favorite to do if I'm spending a lot of time at the computer.

   Before this routine I also like to roll the bottom of my feet with a lacrosse ball.
