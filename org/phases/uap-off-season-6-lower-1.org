    -   If you are unsure of your form, or experience any shoulder pain, do
      not do this exercise. You can try single arm dumbell snatches as an
      alternative or just skip this exercise completely.
    -   Start with elbows straight. Do not jerk the weight up with arms
      bent!
    -   Get your hips back and chest over the bar.
    -   First part of the lift until about the knee is slow, then fast and
      explosive to get the weight overhead.

    -   Place 5 lb weight plates under the heels
    -   Isometric hold for three counts at the bottom of your squat
    -   Explode out of the bottom of your squat after the iso hold
    -   Keep the bar in contact at all times (it should not get airborne).
      You also should not get airborne.

    -   Speed is more important than weight used. Start with bodyweight if
      necessary.

    -   Place on foot on a box or bench that causes your knee to be close to
      90 degrees.
    -   Keep your hips level for the duration of this exercise!
    -   Pull your leg straight up (it won't go very far) and hold for three
      seconds before lowering it back to the bench.
