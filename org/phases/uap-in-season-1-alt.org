   On the two days/week schedule, if you have no league games, pickup, or practices at all during the week then switch out the Full body lifting on your Day 2 for a more movement based day, something like SAQ 2 (Skills), Core, Conditioning 2.

* Full Body 1 - Heavy Day

    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/R-j7IvquHwE/hqdefault.jpg]]

    - "Semi supinated" means that your palms are facing one another. If you do not have a bar that allows for this, use a supinated grip (palms toward you).
    - Keep your chest up. Squeeze shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.
    - If you do not have an assisted chin-up machine, you can use a lat pulldown instead.

    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/hJRCQh02QHI]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/hJRCQh02QHI/hqdefault.jpg]]

    - Keep hips level.
    - Resist rotation of the torso and hips as you pull.
    - This exercise may not feel difficult. You won't "feel the burn." That's ok. It's a total core exercise working on balance and core coordination.

** C1. Pallof Press and Hold

    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/_QmurtmSi7s]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/_QmurtmSi7s/hqdefault.jpg]]

    - Keep shoulders, hips, and ankles in a line
    - Walk ten yards sideways and back, twice over (ie a total of forty yards).
    - In one direction lead with the hands (hand, foot, hand, foot), then back in the other direction lead with the feet.

** B. Side Plank with Hip Abduction
    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_k1Vr9xe4I]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/1_k1Vr9xe4I/hqdefault.jpg]]

    - Lift hips off the ground to come to a plank position
    - Lift leg as high as is comfortable keeping toes pointed forward.
    - Watch for internal or external rotation of the hips and avoid it.

** C. Rowboat
    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/lS5pAo2bqFk]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/lS5pAo2bqFk/hqdefault.jpg]]

    - Keep your chest up and shoulders retracted. This is not a crunch.
    - Move slowly with balance and control. The core should be under tension for the duration of the movement.
* SAQ 1 - Multi-directional
** A. One Foot Forward Hop into Marking Base
    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/eCf9JI8fkcU]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/eCf9JI8fkcU/hqdefault.jpg]]

    - Hop forward off of one foot and land in your marking base.
    - Hold for 2-5 seconds.
    - Reset and repeat for 10 jumps off your left foot and 10 jumps off of your right foot.

** B: Fast Feet Shuffle
    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/UvgZCVcsReA]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/UvgZCVcsReA/hqdefault.jpg]]

    Standing in your marking base, you're going to do the fast feet drill, but this time you'll be shuffling between two cones at about 5 yards (4.5 meters) apart.

    Your goal is to chop your feet as quickly as you can for 10 seconds as you move from cone to cone, maximizing the number of ground contacts while moving laterally from cone to cone.

    Alternate which direction you start. Do 1 where you start toward the left and 1 where you start toward the right.

** C. Side Shuffle with Pause and Reach
    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/GcyU5FrmcPY]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/GcyU5FrmcPY/hqdefault.jpg]]

    Set up two cones/items to mark off 5 yards or 4.5 meters. You'll side shuffle from one object to the other, and reach/pause. (Remember, you're visualizing reaching to block a high release, low release or standard "around" throw at that cone). Focus on minimizing weight shifts. Your goal is to be able to reach without letting your weight shift to your outside leg. Things to add today:

    - Reaching higher in your high release "blocking" - try not to come up on your toes
    - Getting lower to block a low release throw - sit down lower and reach out wider when you get to the cone
    - Explosively pushing off with both legs/feet when you change directions after the pause
    - *Repeat this so you go 8x each way (8x to the left, 8x to the right)*

    *Then couple this workout with immediately moving into [[https://www.ultyresults.com/products/ultimate-athlete-project/categories/685101/posts/2252951][Skills 1]]!*
* SAQ 2 - Linear
** A. Lateral Shuffle to Sprint
    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/hX3TKqIFCbM]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/hX3TKqIFCbM/hqdefault.jpg]]

    - One rep = 7 yard shuffle, 20 yards sprint
    - Rest 60 seconds between reps
    - Alternate directions each rep
    - 3 Reps facing each direction
    - After the last rep, rest 2 minutes

** B. 3-Point Start
    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/j76bJSWSKzg]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/j76bJSWSKzg/hqdefault.jpg]]

    - Rest 60 seconds between reps
    - 3 Reps facing each direction
    - After the last rep, rest 2 minutes

** C. Low Squat Jump
    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/tiaf7MAyJ-w]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/tiaf7MAyJ-w/hqdefault.jpg]]

* Skills 1 & 2
** Skills 1
** A1. Flat Mark Shuffle - forehand
     [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/EEr2OyD9EWQ]]
     [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/EEr2OyD9EWQ/hqdefault.jpg]]

     Set up three cones. the center cone represents the pivot foot. Focus on shuffling laterally along a "flat mark plane." The video sets up a flat mark scenario. Note that Robyn is standing closer to one cone (that represents the open or forehand side).

** A2. Flat Mark Shuffle - backhand
     As above, but for the backhand side of this drill too.

     [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/s4mz8J4vrI8]]
     [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/s4mz8J4vrI8/hqdefault.jpg]]

     Do the drill 8 times forehand, and 8 times backhand.
** Skills 2
** A. Stationary Reaching at Slow Pace
     [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ihSoCpmiTI]]
     [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/1ihSoCpmiTI/hqdefault.jpg]]

     Your partner holds a disc and slowly fakes in each throwing lane. Your goal is to stand in your athletic marking base. Go for a set amount of time (20-30 seconds) and switch with your partner.

** B. Reacting to Disc Fakes
     [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/zuLljGe4dEs]]
     [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/zuLljGe4dEs/hqdefault.jpg]]

     You'll notice Molly (defender in black) resets to the center cone every time and Anna (thrower in white) waits for Molly to reset before she pivots out toward one of the outside cones. You'll also see that Anna is about 3-5 yards away from Molly. This is great, because it gives Molly more time to react (since this is just the first "reactive to a disc" drill that we are doing!).

     Thrower should only pivot out to one direction, wait for the mark to get to the cone, and reset in the middle. Go for a 10 second stall count, and repeat 5 times each.

** C. Reacting Live
     [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/NCHFRK0Lkws]]
     [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/NCHFRK0Lkws/hqdefault.jpg]]

     Your partner is now pivoting and faking quickly, and you get to shuffle side to side while you're reaching. Do a 10 second stall count. Do this three times (you and your partner each go 3x on offense)

* Conditioning 1 & 2
** Conditioning 1: 80/20 full session
    - Run at about 80% of your full sprint speed for 20 seconds. Walking rest for 40 seconds. This is one rep.
    - Pick up where you left off in Off-season Phase 5. Or choose somewhere between 10-16 reps as your starting point. Don't kill yourself on these. This is supposed to be an easier workout and you should not be sore the next day.
    - Add 2 reps each week.

** Conditioning 2: 80/20 light session
    - Run at about 80% of your full sprint speed for 20 seconds. Walking rest for 40 seconds. This is one rep.
    - Do half the number of reps you did on conditioning day 1. The purpose of this workout is to get moving but not to do anything that will leave your legs feeling tired the next day.
