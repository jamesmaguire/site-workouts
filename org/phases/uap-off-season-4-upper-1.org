    - The bar starts resting high on your chest. Grip slightly wider than shoulder width.
    - Dip into about a quarter squat and as you stand push the weight overhead.
    - Legs should be straight at the end of the movement and arms should be locked out.

    - "semi supinated" means that your palms are facing one another. If you do not have a bar that allows for this, use a supinated grip (palms toward you)
    - keep your chest up. squeeze shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.
    - If you do not have an assisted chinup machine, you can use a lat pulldown instead.
