    - First raise your hips to parallel by squeezing your glutes.
    - Maintain the tension in your glutes to keep your hip us as you bring the ball toward you
    - Knees, hips, and shoulders should all be in a line at the top of the movement.
    - Allow the ball to move away from you in a controlled fashion.
    - Lower your hips again to complete the movement.

    - If single leg is too difficult (it's definitely not easy!) it's better to have good form on the two legged version.
