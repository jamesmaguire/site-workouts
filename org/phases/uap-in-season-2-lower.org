    -   Get low but do not leg the back knee smash into the ground
    -   Jump as high as possible and switch which leg is forward mid-flight
    -   Arms can do whatever but using them as you would if running will
      likely feel most natural

    -   Weight rests approximately on hip flexors
    -   Place a sweatshirt or folded up yoga mat between your hips and the
      weight for added comfort.
    -   Heels should be directly under the knees at the top position.
    -   Focus on squeezing your glutes. Keep back straight, not arched.

      seconds before lowering it back to the bench.
