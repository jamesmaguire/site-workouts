  - 15 seconds wide fast foot

* B. Jab Step Agility
      - Works on quick feet, hip action, and change of direction.
      - Center of mass should remain at about the same height as the feet move underneath

	Practice the movement slowly to understand the footwork pattern before working on speed.

  - The goal is to be fast and light on your feet. Fast footwork supports a quick hip turn.
  - You are cutting off the inside, rather than the outside foot.
