   The post season is a great opportunity to spend time on things you may have neglected during your months of hard training. Now is a good time to make progress on your problem areas while you're not adding additional stress.

   If you haven't been doing tissue quality work, now is a good time to learn and to get yourself started on some good habits to take you into next season.

   Scan everything every day (or at least every other) and to spend a few extra minutes on any trigger points or areas of tenderness you might find. Remember, any tissue work is better than no tissue work! Do something every day!

   Here is a good place to start for building your own tissue quality routine.

    You can throw in a kind of active release move at the end for more of a benefit.

* Calves
    I prefer a ball for calves and hamstrings to better target the inside and outside

* Feet
    Oh, and don't forget the feet! If nothing else, use a lacrosse ball on the bottom of the feet once a day to keep them maintained and feeling good!
