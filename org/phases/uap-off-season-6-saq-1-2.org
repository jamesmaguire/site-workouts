   In this power development phase, we are putting some SAQ work in front
   of the lifts for better muscle activation. The SAQ work is still listed
   here separately for those who might not be doing all of the Lifting
   workouts, or who want to throw an additional SAQ module on the front of
   practice or conditioning sessions.

   These workouts are to be preceded by the [[https://ultyresults.mykajabi.com/products/uap/categories/89306/posts/231481][Nonlinear Warmup]].

     -   Hips up. Feet should be closer to hands than you might think.
     -   Lean over the hand on the ground. You should feel that you are close
       to falling over.
     -   You should feel some tension in the hamstrings like you are a spring
       ready to bounce.
     -   Accelerate as explosively as possible out of the starting position.
