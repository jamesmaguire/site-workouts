    comfortable and stable is fine

  -   Get low but do not let the back knee smash into the ground
  -   Jump as high as possible and switch which leg is forward mid-flight
  -   Arms can do whatever but using them as you would if running will
    likely feel most natural

  {{{youtube(d567Ek9MNK8)}}}

  -   Maintain a neutral spine. This is more important than how low you
    go!
  -   Start with the knee of the foot on the ground slightly bent and keep
    the same angle throughtout the movement.
  -   Lower the weight until you feel tension in the hamstring
  -   Hips should move back as you lower the weight.
  -   Contract the glute/hamstring to push your hip forward as you stand
    up.
  -   Do not touch the other leg to the ground at any time if you can help
    it
  -   Do all reps on one leg, then switch to the other leg

*  B2. Backwards Dumbbell lunge

  {{{youtube(BYbEvMbOfMI)}}}

  -   Step back with one leg. Do not let your knee touch the ground
  -   Explosively step forward again using primarily the front leg
  -   Keep the back foot off the ground when you stand up again if
    possible
  -   Do all reps on one leg first and then the other

*  C1. Stability ball Hip Extentions/Lying Curl

  {{{youtube(rs65GbhEBQA)}}}

  -   Use your glutes/hamstrings and keep the spine neutral (don't arch
    your back to get the hips up)
  -   Keep your hips up and envision a straight line between knees and
    shoulders
  -   The exercise can be done with one leg at a time if two legs is not
    challenging

*  C2. Romanian Rhythm Squat

  {{{youtube(MmWbus0fmdo)}}}

  -   Neutral spine, knees in line with toes
  -   Alternate ten reps of quarter squats with ten reps of quarter squats
    to up on your toes
  -   This means you will do 30 regular quarter squats and 20 quarter
    squats to up on toes total
  -   Choose a weight that would be approximately what you could use for
    regular back squats for 10-12 reps (This is an estimate to help you
    know where to start. Your final weight choice may vary)
  -   You will not go to failure on this exercise. Stay fast.
