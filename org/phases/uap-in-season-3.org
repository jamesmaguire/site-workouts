* Schedule & Workout Logs
   [[file:uap-pdfs/inseason3.pdf][Workout log (pdf)]]

   -   In this phase we are assuming that you are doing more ultimate
     specific training. Athletic training time decreases while ultimate
     specific work such as team practice and throwing practice increase.
   -   SAQ workouts can be done before league games, pickup games, throwing
     practice, conditioning sessions or lifting sessions.
   -   Conditioning sessions can be done after league games, pickup games,
     throwing practice, lifting, or SAQ sessions.
   -   Core workouts can be done after SAQ, throwing practice, team
     practice, pickup games, conditioning sessions or lifting sessions.

   If you want to do more work, invest more time in tissue quality work
   (foam rolling and stretching), mobility drills, and the warm up drills.
   It's important to keep your body feeling good and moving well as far
   into the season as possible.

   Prioritize throwing over other things. You can do one extra day of light
   conditioning, but avoid the temptation to overdo it. It is easy to
   underestimate the toll that extra leage/pickup games take on your body.
   Do not wear yourself out.

   Conditioning day 2 of this phase requires a disc and a partner

   This schedule assumes weekend practices or tournaments.
