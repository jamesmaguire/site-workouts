     -   Set up 2 rows of cones about 5-7 yards apart. In each row, three
       cones are placed about 8 yards apart. The two rows are off set by 4
       yards to create a zig-zag pattern.

     -   Use just one row of cones.
     -   Sprint to the first cone, backpedal back, sprint to the second cone,
       backpedal to the first and spin to be running forward to the start
       cone. Run around the start cone and repeat. (the video shows 3
       repeats)

* C. Figure Eight Sprints

     -   Attempt to cut on the inside foot rather than the outside foot (like
       in the jab step).
     -   To use the inside foot, you'll likely slow down a bit before the
       cone and "switch your hips"
