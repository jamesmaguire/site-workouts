* Alternative General Warm-up
   There is no one perfect warm up. How much of a warm up you need will depend on things like your age, the time of day, or how you're feeling on a particular day.  Below are some exercises you can do for a warm up to prepare for any of the lactic of alactic sessions.

   In general, you just want to do progress from less intense movement to movement that is the same intensity of the workout you will be doing.  You'll see I start with mobility drills and move into sprint and multidirectional movement drills.  There are about a million options to choose from for warm-up drills.  Feel free to wander from what is presented below.

** Some Mobility First
    *(click each to display more info)*

** 1. Five Point Lunge
** 2. High Knee Hugs
** 3. Walking Quad Stretch
** 4. Three Point SLDL
     or combo of 3 and 4 in the Walking quad stretch plus SLDL

** Now warm up the body
** 1. Power Skips
** 2. High Knees
** 3. Butt Kicks
** 4. Cariocas
** 5. Shuffles
** 6. Leprechaun Skips
** 7. Zombie Kicks
** 8. Five step bursts
* Linear Warmup
   This is a complete warm-up to do before a linear conditioning session

   part 1

   part 2

   part 3

** Part 1: Physical Warm Up
    Do each of these over 35m / 40 yards...

    1.  Run at 60% speed
    2.  Backwards run with large steps
    3.  Run at 60% speed
    4.  Backward skip
    5.  Casual (low intensity) skip
    6.  Low intensity shuffle. Change direction you're facing every four steps

** Part 2: Mobility
    All exercises for about 15m/20 yards unless otherwise stated..

    1.  lunge and twist (10 yards)
    2.  lunge and reach (10 yards)
    3.  high knee hugs
    4.  cook hip lifts (5 reps each leg. 2 second hold at the top)
    5.  walking quad stretch
    6.  frog squats (10 reps)
    7.  penguin walks (forward 10 yards and backwards 10 yards)
    8.  drinking birds

** Part 3: Nervous System
    All exercises about 15 yards unless specified otherwise. *Allow some rest between exercises* so that you can move at high intensity, especially in exercises 4-8. The purpose here is NOT to elevate your heart rate, but to prepare your nervous system to recuit the maximum number of fast twitch muscle fibers as quickly as possible.

    1.  power skip
    2.  bounding
    3.  high knee run
    4.  butt kicks
    5.  cycle kicks
    6.  Zombie Walks
    7.  arms plus high knee hold
    8.  5 step accelerations (1-2 reps each leg forward)
* Lower Body Lifting Warmup
   There is no one perfect warm up. How much of a warm up you need will depend on things like your age, the rep range of the program you're about to do, or how you're feeling on a particular day. Below are some exercises you can do for a warm up to prepare for the upper legs training session.

   In general, you just want to do some knee dominant and some hip dominant exercises at lower resistance than what you'll be using in the workout.

   I usually start with a few mobility oriented movements (little/no resistance). Examples shown below. Then I will do light weight for 8-10 reps of hamstring curls and 8-10 reps of split squats before jumping in to my first exercise of the program.

   If you are starting off with lifts in the rep range of five or fewer, do some warm up sets of that lift before your working sets. A suggested warm up series would be: one set of 8-10 reps at about 1/3 of the weight you plan for your first working set. One set of 5-8 reps at about 1/2 of the weight of your working set. And one set of 3-5 reps at a bit over 3/4 the weight of your working set. You should not get near failure on these. They are to get your muscles warm and your neurons firing.

   Below are some suggestions for mobility drills and light warmup exercises.

** 1. The Witmer squat
    5-8 reps

** 2. Frog squats (hits the hamstring really well)
    5-8 rep

** 3. Five point lunge
    Three reps each leg

** 4. Three point SLDL
    Three reps each leg

    If you're looking to get a little fancy, try the two full body mobility drills below:

** 1. Backwards spiderman
** 2. Walking bow and arrow
* Nonlinear Warmup
   This is a complete nonlinear warmup. This is the warmup you should do before nonlinear conditioning, SAQ modules, and before playing.

   All exercises are performed for about 20 yards (except the ones that are stationary)

** Part 1: Physical Warm Up
    Each for 35m/40yards...

    1.  Run at 60% speed
    2.  Backwards run with large steps
    3.  Run at 60% speed
    4.  Backward skip/shuffle
    5.  Casual (low intensity) skip
    6.  Low intensity shuffle. Change direction you're facing every four steps

** Part 2: Mobility
** 1 Five Point Lunge

    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/cJvms057Rg4/hqdefault.jpg]]

** Part 3: Nervous System
    All exercises should be done for about 15 yards unless otherwise noted. *Allow some rest between exercises* so that you can move at high intensity with quick, light feet. The purpose here is NOT to elevate your heart rate, but to prepare your nervous system to recuit the maximum number of fast twitch muscle fibers as quickly as possible.

** 1. Cycle kicks
** 2. Lateral high knee skip
** 3. Backwards run
** 4. Lateral skips

* The Power of a good Warmup

   The UAP has such strong programming...it would be a shame to not get all the benefits you can from following it! I'm a strong believer in the power of a short warm up specific to the movement you're going to be doing - you want great range of motion, less stress on your joints and the right musculature working during your session. Rolling on a foam roller for a couple minutes and then jumping into training is not your best bet - here's a breakdown of what I consider to be the best bang-for-your-buck warm up movements for some of the different program days! :)

   First of all, I can't recommend [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/2S3Y1PSrVJU][lacrosse balls]] [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/2S3Y1PSrVJU][lacrosse balls/hqdefault.jpg]] enough...you don't need to hit every point in your body, but spend a couple minutes targeting the places you're tight, in addition to musculature you're going to be using that day. Do this before doing mobility/activation work! If you're naturally mobile in a certain area (ankles, hips) you can totally skip those mobility exercises and shorten your warm up.

    Just a few minutes at the beginning of your time at the gym/on the field can make all the difference - add a thoughtful warm up to the thoughtful programming and you're WINNING. :)

* Upper Body Lifting Warmup
   There is no one perfect warm up. How much of a warm up you need will depend on things like your age, the rep range of the program you're about to do, or how you're feeling on a particular day.

   Below are some exercises you can do for a warm up to prepare for the upper body training session. In general, you just want to do some pulling and some pushing at lower resistance than what you'll be using in the workout.

   If you are starting off with lifts in the rep range of five or fewer, do some warm up sets of that lift before your working sets. A suggested warm up series would be:

   1.  A set of 8-10 reps at about 1/3 of the weight you plan for your first working set
   2.  A set of 5-8 reps at about 1/2 of the weight of your working set,
   3.  A final set of 3-5 reps at a bit over 3/4 the weight of your working set.

   You should not get near failure on these. They are to get your muscles warm and your neurons firing.

   Below are some suggestions for mobility drills and light warmup exercises.
