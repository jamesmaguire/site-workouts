* Conditioning 2

    -   Run at about 80% of your full sprint speed for 20 seconds. Rest for
      40 seconds. This is one rep.
    -   Pick up where you left off in Off-Season Phase 5, or choose
      somewhere between 10-16 reps as your starting point. Don't kill
      yourself on these; this is supposed to be an easier workout and you
      should not be sore the next day.
    -   Add 2 reps each week.
