    - Hips face perpendicular to the wall or a partner and stay that way.
    - Be close enough to the wall that the ball bounces back at you with some force or do this exercise with a partner who catches the med ball and throws it back.
    - Use your core, not your arms to throw the ball.

    - Keep weight directly over head.
    - Core should be engaged at all times (maybe just shy of fully sitting up).
    - Feet are under a bench for stability but avoid using your legs/hip flexors.
