* Schedule & Workout Logs
   [[file:uap-pdfs/preseason1.pdf][Workout log (pdf)]]

   Starting preseason work. The emphasis this phase is strength endurance
   and conditioning. Strength training is around 8-10RM range and rest
   intervals have been shortened to 60 seconds. I have subtracted a day of
   strength training to allow more time for conditioning.

   -   Conditioning workouts can always be done after the leg strength
     training day because it does not matter that your legs are already
     tired.
   -   If doing two types of sessions on the same day, SAQ should be done
     before lifting or conditioning. Lifting should be done before
     conditioning.
   -   Learn to pay attention to how your body is feeling each day. If you
     start feeling run down by the end of each week, you may not be
     getting enough recovery. It is okay NOT to do all of the workouts
     provided. Sometimes less is more.

   For this phase we have a split in training, depending on what surface
   your season is focussed on...

   -   If GRASS --> use the Grass Conditioning & SAQs
   -   If BEACH --> use the Beach Conditioning & SAQs

   [[https://s3.amazonaws.com/ultimate-athlete-project/Schedule+Screenshots/Pre-Season_1.png]]

   Conditioning *can* be done 6 days per week *but only if* you keep the
   volume low enough to recover between sessions. If your shedule is
   flexible, separating your conditioning from your strength training by a
   few hours will allow you to do more work and still recover.

   If you want to do more work, you can also invest more time in your core.
   Core circuits can be done 3-6 days per week. Alternate between circuit 1
   and circuit 2.

* Alternative Power-focused session

   This is a fun workout to try for those already familiar with the UAP. It
   can be used as an alternative power focused workout during a preseason
   or in-season phase of the UAP. Laying out is one of the hardest ultimate
   skills to teach - I think there are some fun ways to train in the gym
   for laying out on the field (Leslie Wu published a great article on
   [[https://ultitraining.wordpress.com/2016/02/22/4-steps-to-a-picture-perfect-layout/)][teaching the layout]].

   As Leslie wrote, the explosive triple extension (ankle/knees/hips) is
   one of the keys to a good layout. We can practice that by doing power
   movements like Hang Cleans or DB Snatches, and also by doing hops up on
   a short box to emphasize extension at the top! There's a significant
   overhead component as well, strengthening the shoulder and its
   surrounding areas to provide stability when you hit the ground (i.e.
   less shoulder separations). And the core component is huge - being able
   to utilize thoracic (mid-back) extension instead of lumbar (low back)
   and being able to stabilize successfully will make your layouts stronger
   and help reduce injury risk.

**  Warm Up

    -   [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_MdN-i7VqA][Inchworms]]
    -   Mid-Back Sweeps
      -   Face down, forehead on hands - inhale deeply, exhale fully and
        right at the end, lift just your upper chest off the floor. Move
        from the mid-back and relax the shoulders. Add a sweep side to
        side after you do a few reps.
    -   Crab Table (elevated bridge, picking up one foot at a time)

    -   [[https://www.instagram.com/p/9m-9jrFRN6/?taken-by=rencaldwell][Landmine Press]]
    -   Step Up with hop (mid-foot on a box, step up and do triple
      extension - if you feel comfortable, take your arm overhead,
      alternating arms, and if that feels good, add a hop at the top)
    -   2 x 45 seconds each side, alternate exercises
    -   [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNA1zOkBdcA][Bench Hip Extensions]]

* Grass Conditioning 1 & 2

   Conditioning 1 should be preceded by the [[https://www.ultyresults.com/products/ultimate-athlete-project/categories/89306/posts/231475][Linear Warmup]].

   Conditioning 2 should be preceded by the[[https://www.ultyresults.com/products/ultimate-athlete-project/categories/89306/posts/231481][Nonlinear Warmup]].

**  Conditioning 1

    This is a continuation of the preparation phase with a few shuttle runs
    thrown in the mix. This workout can be done on an ultimate field doing
    your 80% sprints the full length of the field plus endzones.

    The shuttle runs can be done across the field across and back twice is
    one shuttle run. the shuttle runs should be done at top speed. This is
    why the recovery between shuttle runs is longer.

**  Conditioning 2

    These exercises should be done as a circuit. *All exercises are done
    for 30 seconds with 90 seconds rest.* First to skater hops, rest 90
    seconds, shuffle, rest 90 seconds, short shuttle, etc until the
    prescribed rest of each exercise are done.

** A1. Skater Hops

     [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/sRYnYJNCYpU]]
     [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/sRYnYJNCYpU/hqdefault.jpg]]

     -   Should be at a challenging distance that you can maintain for 30
       seconds.

** A2. Shuffle

     [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/hS3efBLyb-w]]
     [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/hS3efBLyb-w/hqdefault.jpg]]

     -   about 10 yards

** A3. Short Shuttle

     -   This can vary, but I do 5 yards, 10 yards
* Beach SAQ 1 & 2

**  SAQ 1

** A. Zigzag Sprints

     [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/YdgYleKenGM]]
     [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/YdgYleKenGM/hqdefault.jpg]]

     -   Set up 2 rows of cones about 5-7 yards apart. In each row, three
       cones are placed about 8 yards apart. The two rows are off set by 4
       yards to create a zig-zag pattern.

** B. Figure Eight Sprints

     [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/zwHfN0hlEVc]]
     [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/zwHfN0hlEVc/hqdefault.jpg]]

     -   Attempt to cut on the inside foot rather than the outside foot (like
       in the jab step).
     -   To use the inside foot, you'll likely slow down a bit before the
       cone and "switch your hips"

**  SAQ 2

** Three Point Start to 45m Sprint

     [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/j76bJSWSKzg]]
     [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/j76bJSWSKzg/hqdefault.jpg]]

     -   Hips up. Feet should be closer to hands than you might think.
     -   Lean over the hand on the ground. You should feel that you are close
       to falling over.
     -   You should feel some tension in the hamstrings like you are a spring
       ready to bounce.
     -   Accelerate as explosively as possible out of the starting position.
* Beach Conditioning 1 & 2

** Conditioning 1

    This should be preceded by the [[https://www.ultyresults.com/products/uap/categories/89306/posts/231481][Nonlinear Warmup]].

**  A. Shuffle

     [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/aIEw4tUr1ys]]
     [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/aIEw4tUr1ys/hqdefault.jpg]]

     -   about 10 yards

**  B. Short Shuttle

     -   This can vary, but I do 5 yards, 10 yards

**  C. Forward, Back, Spin, Sprint

     [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/WHHYJO_Koyo]]
     [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/WHHYJO_Koyo/hqdefault.jpg]]



** Conditioning 2

    -   Run at about 80% of your full sprint speed for 20 seconds. Rest for
      40 seconds. This is one rep.
    -   Pick up where you left off in Off-Season Phase 5, or choose
      somewhere between 10-16 reps as your starting point. Don't kill
      yourself on these; this is supposed to be an easier workout and you
      should not be sore the next day.
    -   Add 2 reps each week.
