* Schedule & Workout Logs
   [[file:../uap-pdfs/preseason1.pdf][Workout log (pdf)]]

   Starting preseason work. The emphasis this phase is strength endurance
   and conditioning. Strength training is around 8-10RM range and rest
   intervals have been shortened to 60 seconds. I have subtracted a day of
   strength training to allow more time for conditioning.

   -   Conditioning workouts can always be done after the leg strength
     training day because it does not matter that your legs are already
     tired.
   -   If doing two types of sessions on the same day, SAQ should be done
     before lifting or conditioning. Lifting should be done before
     conditioning.
   -   Learn to pay attention to how your body is feeling each day. If you
     start feeling run down by the end of each week, you may not be
     getting enough recovery. It is okay NOT to do all of the workouts
     provided. Sometimes less is more.

   For this phase we have a split in training, depending on what surface
   your season is focussed on...

   -   If GRASS --> use the Grass Conditioning & SAQs
   -   If BEACH --> use the Beach Conditioning & SAQs

   Conditioning *can* be done 6 days per week *but only if* you keep the
   volume low enough to recover between sessions. If your shedule is
   flexible, separating your conditioning from your strength training by a
   few hours will allow you to do more work and still recover.

   If you want to do more work, you can also invest more time in your core.
   Core circuits can be done 3-6 days per week. Alternate between circuit 1
   and circuit 2.
