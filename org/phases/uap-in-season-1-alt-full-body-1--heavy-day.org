  - Shoulders retracted
  - Spine neutral. Look at a spot on the floor about 5 feet in front of you.
  - Get your hips back and chest over the bar

  - Retract your shoulders so that they are flat on the bench.
  - Grip should be slightly wider than shoulder width.

* C2. Semi-supinated grip Pull-up
  {{{youtube(R-j7IvquHwE)}}}

  - "Semi supinated" means that your palms are facing one another. If you do not have a bar that allows for this, use a supinated grip (palms toward you).
  - Keep your chest up. Squeeze shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.
  - If you do not have an assisted chin-up machine, you can use a lat pulldown instead.
