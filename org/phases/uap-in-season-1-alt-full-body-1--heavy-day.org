    - Shoulders retracted
    - Spine neutral. Look at a spot on the floor about 5 feet in front of you.
    - Get your hips back and chest over the bar
    - Arms should be straight at the start of the lift
    - Back remains flat as hips come forward and weight lifts up

    - "Semi supinated" means that your palms are facing one another. If you do not have a bar that allows for this, use a supinated grip (palms toward you).
    - Keep your chest up. Squeeze shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.
    - If you do not have an assisted chin-up machine, you can use a lat pulldown instead.
