    -   "semi-supinated" means that your palms are facing one another. If
      you do not have a bar that allows for this, use a supinated grip
      (palms toward you)
    -   keep your chest up. Squeeze shoulder blades together at the top of
      the movement.
    -   If you do not have an assisted chinup machine, you can use a lat
      pulldown instead.
