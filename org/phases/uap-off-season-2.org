* Schedule & Workout Logs
   [[file:uap-pdfs/offseason2.pdf][Workout log (pdf)]]

   The explosive lifts on leg days and SAQ Day 1 are the most important parts of this phase. Schedule around them, prioritize them each week and make sure you are recovered in time to perform these workouts. Lifting is scheduled four times per week this phase.

   Because we are doing some more explosive work in the weight room this phase, do not do the SAQ workouts more than once per week.

   If you want to do more work, invest more time in your core. Core circuits can be done 3-6 days per week. Don't start off right away with 6 days/week-work up to it. Alternate between circuit 1 and circuit 2.

   Conditioning *can* be done 6 days per week *but only if* you keep the volume low enough to recover between sessions. Do not let your conditioning interfere with your lifting and SAQ work this phase.

** General principles
    - Keep 2 days between the legs and SAQ Day 1 workouts.
    - Conditioning workouts can always be done after the leg strength training day because it does not matter that your legs are already tired.
    - SAQ workouts are NOT conditioning. Do NOT do more than what is listed. You should feel fully recovered between reps and sets. If not, add more rest. No big deal.
    - If doing two types of sessions on the same day, SAQ should be done before lifting or conditioning. Lifting should be done before conditioning.
    - Learn to pay attention to how your body is feeling each day. If you start feeling run down by the end of each week, you may not be getting enough recovery. It is okay NOT to do all of the workouts provided. Sometimes less is more.

* SAQ 1 & 2
   These workouts are to be preceded by the [[https://www.ultyresults.com/products/uap/categories/89306/posts/231481][Nonlinear Warmup]].

** SAQ 1

   This is the main SAQ day and should ideally be done 48 hours before and after the leg lifting days.

** A. Box Jumps
     [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/tVnU1kwoIMM]]
     [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/tVnU1kwoIMM/hqdefault.jpg]]

     - Find a bench, box, or other object that allows you to land on it with a knee angle of greater than 90 degrees. Otherwise, the surface is definitely too high.
     - Land softly with the entire foot on the surface.

** B. Low Squat to Scissor Jumps
     [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mf7cZzcCyuc]]
     [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/Mf7cZzcCyuc/hqdefault.jpg]]

     [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/zT_jMofv4V8]]
     [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/zT_jMofv4V8/hqdefault.jpg]]

     - Slam the working leg onto the bench and push yourself as high into the air as possible.

** D1. Lean/Fall/Run
     [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y2aCnrTvqZo]]
     [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/Y2aCnrTvqZo/hqdefault.jpg]]

     - Get up on the balls of your feet and lean forward.
     - Let yourself lean as far as you can before falling out into a sprint.
     - Some of these will be more coordinated than others. No worries. Your body will learn the most forward leaning position it can handle through trial and error.

** D2. Three Point Start
     [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/j76bJSWSKzg]]
     [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/j76bJSWSKzg/hqdefault.jpg]]

     - You should feel some tension in the hamstrings like you are a spring ready to bounce.
     - Accelerate as explosively as possible out of the starting position.

** SAQ 2

     - Alternate starting directions each set.
     - This builds on your lateral starts from last phase.
     - First five yards, hips should remain mostly forward.
     - Second ten yards turn the hips but open early to change directions with maximal efficiency. Same thing for the last turn.

** C. Shuffle to Sprint
     [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/hX3TKqIFCbM]]
     [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/hX3TKqIFCbM/hqdefault.jpg]]

* Core 1
** A1. Paused Rotation Plank
    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/qrFJTX1BAR4]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/qrFJTX1BAR4/hqdefault.jpg]]

    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/bFdjJzvzmok]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/bFdjJzvzmok/hqdefault.jpg]]

    - Engage the lower core to keep hips stable.
    - Check for hip motion in the lowering leg by placing your hand above the hip bone.
    - Lower only as far as there is no movement of the hip.
    - If you cannot do this exercise as shown, start with the non working leg propped against something (a doorframe works well) to keep it upright.
* Core 2
** A1. Kneeling Overhead Pallov Press
    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/tGgkOlsd7Pc]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/tGgkOlsd7Pc/hqdefault.jpg]]

    - Knee closest to the cable column is on the floor
    - Attempt to hold the cable handle straight above your head without leaning in either direction.

** A2. Kneeling Reverse Half Chop

    [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/zVTQi0JZ6sA]]
    [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/zVTQi0JZ6sA/hqdefault.jpg]]

    - Keep hips level.
    - Resist rotation of the torso and hips as you pull.
    - This exercise may not feel difficult. You won't "feel the burn." That's ok. It's a total core exercise working on balance and core coordination.
* Conditioning
   *The conditioning this phase is meant to be more restorative than taxing.* It's not supposed to be hard. We are just maintaining a bit of what you've got and getting blood circulating to help with the recovery from your lifting and plyometric sessions.

   You will be running intervals of a 1:1 work : rest ratio. Thirty seconds running, thirty seconds of walking. Running should be done at about 70% sprint speed or about what your timed mile pace would be. It is a run, not a jog. But also not a sprint. The purpose is to run at a pace that elicits good running form. Run at the pace that has you naturally landing on the mid or forefoot. No heel striking of shuffling or anything other than good, happy running form!

   Start with about 15-20 reps. This workout should be preceeded by the linear warmup. So though it is a short workout, your heart rate will still be elevated for over 20 minutes.

** This is what your training log looks like this phase:
    [[https://s3.amazonaws.com/kajabi-media/assets/projects/10479/assets_bag/original/ph2conditioningtable.png?1346355132]]

** Other options
    Because conditioning is not the focus of this phase, feel free to do some other type of conditioning of your choice. Just don't do anything that prevents your full recovery by the next leg lifting day or SAQ workout.

    1. [A Multidirectional Movement
    Workout.](http://melissasultimatefitness.com/2011/complete-multidirectional-movement-workout/) Has more variety. A good choice if you're not playing ultimate at the moment. Do the movements at lower intensity than shown on the blog.

    2. [Other Interval
    Protocols.](http://melissasultimatefitness.com/2010/interval-training-for-cardiovascular-fitness-part-iii-three-interval-protocols-ive-used-successfully/) Any of these can work just fine for your conditioning this phase. Try them all!
