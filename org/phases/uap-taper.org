* Philosophy of a Taper

   This video gives a few suggestions on how to modify your workouts
   starting about 2 weeks before tryouts. Bullet points below are a good
   summary and give you the basic points you need to know.

   Keep in mind that the season is too long to taper before every
   tournament. If you spend too much time worrying about absolute peak
   performance every weekend, then you will not make gains during the
   season and may even go backwards. Taper for only the most important
   events of your season. For some of you, this may mean tapering for
   tryouts, for others of you it won't.

   The goal is to have your body feeling loose, energized, and mobile and
   your nervous system ready. These suggestions are made with these goals
   in mind.

   1.  Two weeks before the event, cut all of your normal training by one
      third. Still do all of the workouts, but instead of 3 sets, do 2.
      This goes for both running and strength training.
   2.  One week from the event, cut another third of your training. So now
      to one set instead of three, for example. Again, you still want to
      do work at a high intensity to maintain the neural adaptations. But
      you want to allow your body some space for extra physical recovery.
   3.  The day before the event, do an extended warm up (maybe some extra
      mobility drills or running form drills) and 1/3 of an alactic
      workout. Basically you want to do a little bit of full intensity
      activity. This may help prevent you from coming out "flat" at the
      start of your event. It is about keeping teh nervous system primed
      for action!
   4.  Mobility and the nervous system excitement change daily. This is why
      we still do something with those systems the day before.
   5.  Conditioning is easily maintained so you could easily cut out your
      lactic workouts and be totally fine. while you are tapering, don't
      worry about your conditioning. You're not going to lose anything.
      The upside of being well rested is greater than the possible
      downside of a minimal temporary decrease in conditioning level.
* Schedule & Workout Logs
   [[file:uap-pdfs/taper0.pdf][Workout log (pdf)]]

   On this page you'll find everything you need to complete the
   conditioning sessions of the Taper Phase. If you ever need a lighter day
   for recovery, refer to the 80/20 workout from In Season 1.

   In this phase, your primary goal is to feel both physically and
   psychologically prepared for your most important tournament. Trust your
   training. You will be dramatically decreasing your volume of work. It is
   important to realize that you've already done the work necessary. Gains
   in performance are now going to come from complete recovery, not from
   training.

   Workouts will be done at the same intensity. Sprinting and lifting at
   high intensity are still important for two reasons. 1. You want to keep
   your mobility. Being inactive or not sprinting may cause a temporary
   loss of movement quality. 2. We want to keep the nervous system primed
   for peak performance. High-intensity movements keep the nervous system
   sharp.

   If you want to do more work, invest more time in tissue quality work
   (foam rolling and stretching), mobility drills, and the warm-up drills,
   and most critically: *GET MORE SLEEP!*

   -   SAQ workouts can be done before league games, pickup games, throwing
     practice, conditioning sessions or lifting sessions.
   -   Conditioning sessions can be done after league games, pickup games,
     throwing practice, lifting, or SAQ sessions. It is totally okay to
     cut out conditioning workouts two weeks prior to the tournament if
     you are also having practices, etc.
   -   Core workouts can be done after SAQ, throwing practice, team
     practice, pickup games, conditioning sessions or lifting sessions.
   -   Relax! You've done the training already. You are not going
     to *significantly* alter your physical abilities, positively or
     negatively, in the 2-3 weeks prior to the big show.
   -   Feel free to substitute your favorite training sessions from the UAP
     for similar type workouts in the taper phase (as long as you cut
     down on the volume to the same as the taper phase). Do things that
     make you feel confident and athletic!

   This schedule assumes weekend practices/tournaments, and for the
   6/days/week version you should get some kind of active rest on the
   Monday!
