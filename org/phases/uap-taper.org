   On this page you'll find everything you need to complete the
   conditioning sessions of the Taper Phase. If you ever need a lighter day
   for recovery, refer to the 80/20 workout from In Season 1.

   In this phase, your primary goal is to feel both physically and
   psychologically prepared for your most important tournament. Trust your
   training. You will be dramatically decreasing your volume of work. It is
   important to realize that you've already done the work necessary. Gains
   in performance are now going to come from complete recovery, not from
   training.

   Workouts will be done at the same intensity. Sprinting and lifting at
   high intensity are still important for two reasons. 1. You want to keep
   your mobility. Being inactive or not sprinting may cause a temporary
   loss of movement quality. 2. We want to keep the nervous system primed
   for peak performance. High-intensity movements keep the nervous system
   sharp.

   If you want to do more work, invest more time in tissue quality work
   (foam rolling and stretching), mobility drills, and the warm-up drills,
   and most critically: *GET MORE SLEEP!*

   -   SAQ workouts can be done before league games, pickup games, throwing
     practice, conditioning sessions or lifting sessions.
   -   Conditioning sessions can be done after league games, pickup games,
     throwing practice, lifting, or SAQ sessions. It is totally okay to
     cut out conditioning workouts two weeks prior to the tournament if
     you are also having practices, etc.
   -   Core workouts can be done after SAQ, throwing practice, team
     practice, pickup games, conditioning sessions or lifting sessions.
   -   Relax! You've done the training already. You are not going
     to *significantly* alter your physical abilities, positively or
     negatively, in the 2-3 weeks prior to the big show.
   -   Feel free to substitute your favorite training sessions from the UAP
     for similar type workouts in the taper phase (as long as you cut
     down on the volume to the same as the taper phase). Do things that
     make you feel confident and athletic!

   This schedule assumes weekend practices/tournaments, and for the
   6/days/week version you should get some kind of active rest on the
   Monday!
