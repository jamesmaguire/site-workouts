* Introductory Video
   After all of your hard work, it's time for a much needed break! Post Season, give yourself permission to slack off a bit, guilt free. Still, it's important to stay active. Now's a great time for playing other sports, learning something new, and refreshing your mind and body.
* Learn Something New
   The post-season is a great time for cross training activities. You want to stay active but maybe take a mental and physical break from ultimate before jumping back into hard training again.

   I like to take some time in the post season to learn a new skill. This could be something I want to apply to my training later or just something that looks like fun that I don't normally have time to do.

** 1. Parkour
    Parkour originated in France. The main goal of practicing Parkour is to use and expand upon your body's natural movement patterns while in motion. There is a lot of vaulting over obstacles, balancing, and learning to land precisely and softly on small surfaces. There is no real organized method of Parkour. The object is to play, to learn what your body can do, and to use it in new ways.

    I hooked up with a local Parkour club and they got me started on a few moves and things to practice. This is a great post season activity for working on balance!

    Many people learn by watcing videos of others on YouTube. Here's David Bell, the originator of the Parkour movement. Obviously, don't try this at home:

** 2. Jump Rope Training
    Learning to jump rops is a surprisingly humbling experience (wasn't I good at this at, like, age six?). But, it is also something you can get much better at very quickly. Start by just jumping regularly and working on your speed (jumps per minute) and endurance. Start gradually!

    Jumping rope is great for working on the elasticity in the calves and can have a nice carryover to your plyometrci exercises.

    Here is a nice little intro video with suggestions on how to get started:

    And two examples of where you can go wtih jump rope training:

    Here's Buddy Lee who really helped to popularize jump rope training:

** 3. Climbing
    I've only been climbing a few times so I'm no expert. May help with general grip strength. Not sure how much carryover there would be to disc gripping. But also good for working on shoulder strength and balance.

** 4. Hiking/Trailrunning
    Walking and running on unstable uneven surfaces is fantastic for proprioception!

    What's your favorite fun physical activity when you're not playing ultimate? *Tell us what you're up to in your post-season activities in the comments below!*
* Morning Mobility
   You may be relaxing your workout and warm up regimen in the post season, and that's fine. We want this month to be a time of regeneration. An important part of regeneration is getting blood and nutrients to the joints and muscle tissues of the body.

   Doing some mobility work every day is a great way to keep the joints healthy and mobile so they're ready to get back in action when you're ready to start your training again.

   This is a morning mobility routine that I use to loosen up my spine, shoulders, and hips on mornings when I'm feeling not so great. When I do this routine regularly, I'm more relaxed throughout the day.

   The beauty of this routine is that it takes less than ten minutes once you learn all of the moves. Make this part of your morning routine just like brushing your teeth. You can also sprinkle these movements throughout the day. Eagle shoulders are my favorite to do if I'm spending a lot of time at the computer.

   Before this routine I also like to roll the bottom of my feet with a lacrosse ball.

** 1. Neck Rolls

* Post-season & Off Season Book List
   Post-season might leave you wtih some extra time on your hands now that practices are over. What a great opportunity to relax with a book! Post-season you might want to get your ming off of ultimate. Just like it's a good time for cross training, maybe you want to take this opportunity to read about athletes in other sports. Off-season you may want to learn more about the training principles behind The Ultimate Athlete Project, or maybe you want to work on some other aspect of your game. Below are a few book suggestions for all purposes.

* Tissue Quality Routine
   The post season is a great opportunity to spend time on things you may have neglected during your months of hard training. Now is a good time to make progress on your problem areas while you're not adding additional stress.

   If you haven't been doing tissue quality work, now is a good time to learn and to get yourself started on some good habits to take you into next season.

   [[https://www.youtube.com/embed/dr3bj1rSCTc]]
   [[https://img.youtube.com/vi/dr3bj1rSCTc/hqdefault.jpg]]

   Scan everything every day (or at least every other) and to spend a few extra minutes on any trigger points or areas of tenderness you might find. Remember, any tissue work is better than no tissue work! Do something every day!

   Here is a good place to start for building your own tissue quality routine.

** Feet
