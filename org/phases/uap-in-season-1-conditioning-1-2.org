*  Conditioning 1: 80/20

  -   Run at about 80% of your full sprint speed for 20 seconds. Rest for
    40 seconds. This is one rep.
  -   Pick up where you left off in Phase 5. Or choose somewhere between
    10-16 reps as your starting point. Don't kill yourself on these.
    This is supposed to be an easier workout and you should not be sore
    the next day.
  -   Add 2 reps each week.

*  Conditioning 2: 160 Shuttle

  -   This workout should be preceded by the Nonlinear Warmup unless doing
    the workout after practice, league game, or pickup.
  -   Set up two cones 40 yards apart or use the width of an ultimate
    field. Sprinting to the other side and back twice is a 160 shuttle.
    All reps should be performed as fast as possible.
  -   For Week 1 complete 2 sets of 2 reps and 1 set of 1 rep. Rest 90s
    between reps and 120s between sets.
  -   For all other weeks complete 3 sets of 2 reps each. Still rest 90s
    between reps and 120s between sets.
