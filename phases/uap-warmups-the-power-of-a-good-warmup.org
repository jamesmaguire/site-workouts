The UAP has such strong programming...it would be a shame to not get all the benefits you can from following it! I'm a strong believer in the power of a short warm up specific to the movement you're going to be doing - you want great range of motion, less stress on your joints and the right musculature working during your session. Rolling on a foam roller for a couple minutes and then jumping into training is not your best bet - here's a breakdown of what I consider to be the best bang-for-your-buck warm up movements for some of the different program days! :)

First of all, I can't recommend {{{youtubelink(2S3Y1PSrVJU, lacrosse balls)}}} enough...you don't need to hit every point in your body, but spend a couple minutes targeting the places you're tight, in addition to musculature you're going to be using that day. Do this before doing mobility/activation work! If you're naturally mobile in a certain area (ankles, hips) you can totally skip those mobility exercises and shorten your warm up.

* Note
  Just a few minutes at the beginning of your time at the gym/on the field can make all the difference - add a thoughtful warm up to the thoughtful programming and you're WINNING. :)
