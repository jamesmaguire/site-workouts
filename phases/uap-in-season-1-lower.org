*  A1. Front Squat

  {{{youtube(JFEqNGbpKaw)}}}

  -   The bar is resting on your clavicles (collarbone) and held there
    with your hands in an open grip (fingers not wrapped around the
    bar).
  -   As in all squatting, maintain a neutral spine, get your butt back,
    weight shifted toward the heels, and chest tall.

*  A2. Tuck Jumps

  {{{youtube(uCgaMLjr20I)}}}

  -   Minimize ground contact time.
  -   Land quietly on the mid-forefoot and explode up again as quickly as
    possible.
  -   Pull your knees up as high as possible.
  -   Keep the spine neutral and chest tall! Knees come up to meet the
    chest, not the other way around.

*  B1. Barbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)

  {{{youtube(XxM-QNjznF0)}}}

  -   Get your hips back. Knees bent at about 10-15 degrees.
  -   Maintain a neutral spine!
  -   Keep the weight close to your legs (not doing so will cause you to
    use your back)
  -   Lower the weight until you feel the slight stretch in the back of
    your hamstrings.
  -   Use your glutes and hamstrings to push your hips forward and cause
    you to stand up.

*  B2. Walking Lunges

  {{{youtube(NTiYltLIVB0)}}}

  -   Aim for 90 degree angle of the lunging knee but do not let your back
    knee touch the ground.
  -   Step directly into the next lunge without pausing at the top of the
    movement.
  -   Keep your shoulders locked back and chest up.
  -   (Reps are per leg, not total)

*  C1. Stability Ball Hip Extension / Lying Curl

  {{{youtube(h1Us6x0fuPI)}}}

  -   First raise your hips to parallel by squeezing your glutes.
  -   Maintain the tension in your glutes to keep your hip us as you bring
    the ball toward you
  -   Knees, hips, and shoulders should all be in a line at the top of the
    movement.
  -   Allow the ball to move away from you in a controlled fashion.
  -   Lower your hips again to complete the movement.

*  Alternate two legged version

  {{{youtube(MEqwmz-nfVo)}}}

  -   If single leg is too difficult (it's definitely not easy!) it's
    better to have good form on the two legged version.

*  C2. Romanian Rhythm Squats

  {{{youtube(MmWbus0fmdo)}}}

  -   Fast quarter squats. Alternate 10 reps with the whole foot on the
    ground with ten reps going up on your toes until you get to 50 reps.
  -   Concentrate on using your hips. Maintain good posture as usual.
