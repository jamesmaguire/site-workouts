This is a complete warm-up to do before a linear conditioning session

* Part 1: Physical Warm Up
  Do each of these over 35m / 40 yards...

  1. Run at 60% speed
  2. Backwards run with large steps
  3. Run at 60% speed
  4. Backward skip
  5. Casual (low intensity) skip
  6. Low intensity shuffle. Change direction you're facing every four steps

* Part 2: Mobility
  All exercises for about 15m/20 yards unless otherwise stated..

  1. lunge and twist (10 yards)
  2. lunge and reach (10 yards)
  3. high knee hugs
  4. cook hip lifts (5 reps each leg. 2 second hold at the top)
  5. walking quad stretch
  6. frog squats (10 reps)
  7. penguin walks (forward 10 yards and backwards 10 yards)
  8. drinking birds

* Part 3: Nervous System
  All exercises about 15 yards unless specified otherwise. *Allow some rest between exercises* so that you can move at high intensity, especially in exercises 4-8. The purpose here is NOT to elevate your heart rate, but to prepare your nervous system to recuit the maximum number of fast twitch muscle fibers as quickly as possible.

  1. power skip
  2. bounding
  3. high knee run
  4. butt kicks
  5. cycle kicks
  6. Zombie Walks
  7. arms plus high knee hold
  8. 5 step accelerations (1-2 reps each leg forward)
