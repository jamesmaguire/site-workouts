* Conditioning 2

  -   Run at about 80% of your full sprint speed for 20 seconds. Rest for
    40 seconds. This is one rep.
  -   Pick up where you left off in Off-Season Phase 5, or choose
    somewhere between 10-16 reps as your starting point. Don't kill
    yourself on these; this is supposed to be an easier workout and you
    should not be sore the next day.
  -   Add 2 reps each week.
