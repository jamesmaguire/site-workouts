*  A1. Backward Medicine Ball Toss

  {{{youtube(ySGKPo_1VT0)}}}

  -   Bring the ball down between your legs
  -   Think about pushing your hips back as if in a deadlift
  -   Use your whole body (pop those hips forward!) to propel the ball us
    and back over your head
  -   Ignore the sprinting in the video!

*  A2. One Leg Medicine Ball Toss

  {{{youtube(WFRybTvdVnM)}}}

  -   Stand on one leg holding the medicine ball in both hands.
  -   The throw should feel like a single leg countermovement jump except
    that the ball is propelled straight up and you stay mostly on the
    ground.
  -   The medicine ball should be light (approx. 4-8 pounds).
  -   If you do not have a medicine ball, leap off of one leg and land on
    both feet.

*  B1. Deadlift

  {{{youtube(PrBBOFdOHk8)}}}

  -   Shoulders retracted.
  -   Spine neutral. Look at a spot on the floor about 5 feet in front of
    you.
  -   Get your hips back and chest over the bar
  -   Arms should be straight at the start of the lift
  -   Back remains flat as hips come forward and weight lifts up.

*  B2. Box Jumps

  {{{youtube(tVnU1kwoIMM)}}}

  -   Find a bench, box, or other object that allows you to land on it
    with a knee angle of greater than 90 degrees. Otherwise, the surface
    is definitely too high.
  -   Land softly with the entire foot on the surface.

*  C1. Paused Heel-Elevated Hip Lift

  {{{youtube(EFLq2nE7up8)}}}

  -   Elevate the foot of the working leg on a step
  -   Can be elevated on a Bosu ball for added difficulty.
  -   Nonworking leg remains straight
  -   Pause at the top of the movement

*  C2. Speed Calf Raises

  {{{youtube(mRI2dU4Dcgc)}}}

  -   Place your midfoot on a step or box. Hold onto something to help
    your balance.
  -   Get full range of motion on these and really squeeze your calves at
    the top for a full contraction
  -   Do these as quickly and explosively as possible without jumping.
