* 1. The 80/20 workout

  This is the standard workout you'll be using for the duration of the program.

  Before your first linear workout (the 80/20 workout) you need to find your starting point. The starting number of reps will be dependent on your current fitness level. The 80/20 workout consists of running at 80% sprint speed for 20 seconds and walking for 40 seconds.&nbsp; The goal of your first workout will be to experiment with pacing and choose a starting point for your workouts.&nbsp; The running pace should feel like a fast run more than a sprint. You should be at a speed at which youâ€™re landing a bit forward of the midfoot.&nbsp; It should feel like a pleasant speed, not a forced speed. Try to maintain this speed for every repetition.&nbsp; When it starts feeling like you are struggling to maintain good form or that you are not able to complete a repetition at the same pace, then stop.&nbsp; This will be your test number and you will start your workouts at this number minus 2 repetitions. You will be starting at a number of repetitions lower than what you can do to ensure complete recovery between workouts.

  Read the pdf to see how many reps you should do throughout the whole program, whenever it says "test," you are using the initial test number.
