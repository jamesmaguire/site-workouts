*  A1. Russian Step Ups

  {{{youtube(jSnoZlYUttg)}}}

  -   find a rhythm, be explosive, drive the knee up!
  -   Use the foot on the bench to initiate and drive the movement. Don't
    "bounce" off the foot landing on the ground.

*  A2. Squat to Press

  {{{youtube(1O8jb9KLtf4)}}}

  -   Find a rhythm and move quickly
  -   Aim for parallel in the squats
  -   The press should move continuously with momentum coming from the
    squat

*  B1. DB King Squat

  {{{youtube(7P6tu--nyVA)}}}

  -   First part of the exercise is a pendulum RDL. Keep knee at about 10
    degree bend. Get the back leg's thigh close to parallel.
  -   On one leg squat down getting the weight close to (but not touching)
    the ground. Attempt to keep the rest of the body frozen in the RDL
    position
  -   Keep your back flat and shoulders retracted through the whole
    exercises.
  -   (Note that some of my demo reps are better than others. :-)
    Hopefully you get the idea. This one's new for me too. Good luck!)

*  B2. Diagonal Walking DB Lunge

  {{{youtube(o9MgO2kMiAM)}}}

  -   Keep toes and hips forward. Lunge diagonal to the forward direction.
  -   It may become difficult to hold the dumbells. You can either think
    of this as grip strength training or use straps. Pretty sure you can
    get straps for less than $15 at most sporting goods stores.
