* A1. Leg Lowering

  {{{youtube(U6Z2BbzQo1k)}}}

  -   Engage the lower core to keep hips stable.
  -   Check for hip motion in the lowering leg by placing your hand above
    the hip bone.
  -   Lower only as far as there is no movement of the hip.
  -   If you cannot do this exercise as shown, start with the non working
    leg propped against something (a doorframe works well) to keep it
    upright.
