* Schedule & Workout Logs
  [[file:../../uap-pdfs/preseason2.pdf][Workout log (pdf)]]

  This is the second phase of preseason work. The main goals are strength
  and power endurance. We are going to accomplish these goals primarily
  using circuit training. You'll do a power circuit twice per week and a
  strength circuit once per week. Workouts will be very short but very
  intense.

  The SAQ work will be done before the conditioning workouts this week.
  This is mostly for maintenance and don't expect to see big gains in
  speed this phase.

** General Principles

   -   Learn to pay attention to how your body is feeling each day. If you
     start feeling run down by the end of each week, you may not be
     getting enough recovery. It is okay NOT to do all of the workouts
     provided. Sometimes less is more.
   -   If you feel nauseated or dizzy, increase the rest periods. Making
     yourself vomit will not help the speed of your adaptation.

     For this phase we have a split in training, depending on what surface
     your season is focussed on...

     -   If GRASS --> use the standard Conditioning & SAQs
     -   If BEACH --> use the Beach Conditioning & SAQs

     Core circuits can be done 3-6 days per week. Alternate between circuit 1
     and circuit 2.

     Conditioning *can* be done 6 days per week *but only if* you keep the
     volume low enough to recover between sessions. *If you want to do
     conditioning on the same day as the circuit training, separate the
     workouts by a few hours*. This will allow you to do more work and still
     recover.
